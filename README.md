## Description

This module behaves a lot like the [entityconnect](/project/entityconnect) module. It will add a "Create entity" link to [Entity Reference](/project/entity_reference) fields. This "Create entity" link will open the configured [Flexiform](/project/flexiform) form in a modal window. The entity created in the submission of the [Flexiform](/project/flexiform) is populated in the [Entity Reference](/project/entity_reference) field


### Important note about functionality
Currently only supports creating a new entity in the form, not loading an existing entity to edit.


## Dependencies

This module requires the following modules to also be installed:

  * [Flexiform](/project/flexiform)
  * [Entity Reference](/project/entity_reference)
  * [CTools](/project/ctools)

## Installation

[Download and install](/docs/7/extending-drupal-7/installing-drupal-7-contributed-modules) this module just as you would any other module.
